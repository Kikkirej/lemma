# LEMMA Example No. 3

This modeling example for the [Language Ecosystem for Modeling Microservice Architecture (LEMMA)](https://github.com/SeelabFhdo/lemma/) contains models that recover the software architecture of [Lakeside Mutual](https://github.com/Microservice-API-Patterns/LakesideMutual). Lakeside Mutual is an example application for [Microservice API Patterns (MAP)](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/) and other patterns (DDD, PoEAA, EIP).

The following components of Lakeside Mutual were recovered leveraging LEMMA:
- `customer-core`
- `customer-management-backend`
- `customer-self-service-backend`
- `policy-management-backend`

Moreover, technology models were created with LEMMA's Technology Modeling Language [3] for the following technologies being employed by Lakeside Mutual:
- [ActiveMQ](https://activemq.apache.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Embedded Architectural Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/e-adr/)
- Java
- [Microservice API Patterns](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/)

A detailed technical report, which describes our steps in recovering Lakeside Mutual's software architecture leveraging LEMMA, as well as the syntax and semantics of the applied modeling languages, may be obtained via e-mail from florian [DOT] rademacher [AT] fh-dortmund [DOT] de.
