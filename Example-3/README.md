# LEMMA Example No. 3

This modeling example for the [Language Ecosystem for Modeling Microservice Architecture (LEMMA)](https://github.com/SeelabFhdo/lemma/) contains models that reconstruct the software architecture of [Lakeside Mutual](https://github.com/Microservice-API-Patterns/LakesideMutual). Lakeside Mutual is an example application for [Microservice API Patterns (MAP)](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/) and other patterns (DDD, PoEAA, EIP).

The following components of Lakeside Mutual were reconstructed leveraging LEMMA:
- `customer-core`
- `customer-management-backend`
- `customer-self-service-backend`
- `eureka-server`
- `policy-management-backend`
- `spring-boot-admin`

Moreover, technology models were created with LEMMA's Technology Modeling Language [3] for the following technologies being employed by Lakeside Mutual:
- [ActiveMQ](https://activemq.apache.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Embedded Architectural Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/e-adr/)
- [Eureka](https://www.github.com/Netflix/eureka)
- [Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix)
- [Java/Spring](https://www.spring.io)
- [Microservice API Patterns](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/)
